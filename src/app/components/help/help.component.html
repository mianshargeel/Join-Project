    <h3>What is Join?</h3>
    <p>
      <span>Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and
      built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development
      bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

      flow). <span>Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users
      manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

    <h3>How to use it</h3>
    <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span>Join</span>:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <span>Exploring the Board:</span><br>
        When you log in to <span>Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This
        board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",
        "In Progress", "Await feedback" and "Done".
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Creating Contacts:</span><br>
        In <span>Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
        projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill
        in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
        tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Adding Cards:</span><br>
        Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards
        represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate
        list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
        task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Moving Cards:</span><br>
        As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the
        board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Deleting Cards:</span><br>
        Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or
        delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board.
        Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
        irreversible.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Remember that using <span>Join</span> effectively requires consistent
      updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current
      state of your project.
