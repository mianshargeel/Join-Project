/* The auth.guard.ts file is a route guard. Itâ€™s used in Angular to protect certain routes, ensuring only authenticated users (users logged in) can access them
CanActivateFn is a built-in Angular type that defines a function-style route guard.
It returns either: true or false (synchronously) or a Promise<boolean> or Observable<boolean> (asynchronously), onAuthStateChanged is a Firebase method that listens to login/logout changes and gives you the current user if one is logged in.
